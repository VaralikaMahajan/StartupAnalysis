[["index.html", "Startup Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " Startup Analysis Varalika Mahajan and Vrinda Bhat 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction Startups play a major role in the development of the economic growth of the country. They promote ideation, spur innovation and thereby generate employment strategies to make accentuated growth in the economy. There has been an exponential rise in the number of startups over the past few years. To be ahead of the competition, there is a necessity to predict the success of startups thereby allowing investors to find companies that have the potential for rapid growth. 1.1 Motivation Research study has recognized the importance of startups for economic dynamism and competition. The startup ecosystem is highly uncertain and its volatile nature makes it challenging to examine and understand data to determine if a firm will succeed. The time and computationally costly nature of this prediction problem necessitate the use of a quantified and visually understandable model, which allows for an objective approach to predicting startup success or not. According to a recent New York Times piece, an unprecedented number of companies, easily 25 and probably exceeding 40, are now valued at $1 billion or more. That figure is expected to reach 100 in a year. As a result, a record number of entrepreneurs is going to be the future. 1.2 Objective The project’s goal is to forecast whether a currently existing startup will be a success or a failure. A company’s success is defined based on various factors including a number of founders, investors, age of the company, funding round, acquisition, domain, and much more. Our aim is to visualize all these factors across the leading unicorns like Uber, and Airbnb against the upcoming unicorns, DataBricks, and FTX and further see, what they did differently against the failed startups. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic The cost of starting a business is at an all-time low. If we recall the time when developing an eCommerce website might easily cost a million dollars. Now, One can easily build a website for nearly nothing and get started with their latest invention or personal services. Two facts arise- 1. Startups are growing at an unexpectable rate. 2. 90% of startups fail. With this growth, there is a huge opportunity to analyze, “What are the reasons behind the success of a startup, and what leads to the downfall?”. The following are the key factors for the success of startups: Idea, Founding Team, Investors, category, city, age of the company, amount raised, and many more; being all factors equally relevant in the analysis. These factors have had a wide impact on subsequent research. Success factors have been linked to certain amounts of turnover, as well as to the dedication of the founders, their commercial capacity, the age of the company, the number of employees, the existence of promoter partners in the company, the technological skills of the promoter partners and the startup’s ability to exceed the break-even point. 2.1.1 Scope This analysis aims to shed light on this issue through the statistical analysis of a samples of startup data including that of former and current unicorns. Through a detailed study of the selected daatsets, but from the perspective of business experience, the scope is to identify the comparative relevance of those factors that recent research has highlighted as the main drivers of start-up success. Our analysis allows us to define a core of practical business success factors. This core makes it possible to identify the intersection between success in business practice and predicting the success of startups. In addition, some differences found between the geographic areas, suggest that financial and developmental characteristics influence the weight given to the various reasons for success, which further enhances the research in this area. 2.2 Data availability Dataset 1: List of unicorn companies Link: https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies Source: CBN Insights Format of the dataset: CSV Description: A unicorn company, or unicorn startup, is a private company with a valuation over $1 billion. As of October 2022, there are over 1,200 unicorns around the world. Popular former unicorns include Airbnb, Facebook and Google. Variants include a decacorn, valued at over $10 billion, and a hectocorn, valued at over $100 billion. The dataset consists of unicorn companies all over the globe, from various industries from software to e-Commerce. The dataset consists of current unicorns in the industry, with columns - Company, Valuation, Date joined, Country, City, Industry, and Investors. Column Name Description Company Name Name of the startup Valuation Company’s net worth Date Joined Company’s Unicorn establishment date Country Country of Startup City City of Startup Industry Domain of Startup Investors Investing members of the startup Dataset 2: List of startups Link: https://github.com/Kerenn/Cs210_StandupStartups/blob/master/AB.csv Source: Github Format of the dataset: CSV Description: This dataset includes the best-funded growth startups, defined by the total amount raised in different rounds in various industries ranging from software to e-Commerce. The dataset consists of a list of startups, with the following columns - Company, Status(Operational or Exited), Amounts_raised_in_different_funding_rounds, Categories, YCombinatorYear, HeadquartersCity. Column Name Description Company Name Name of the startup Status Company’s operating status Amount raised Amount raised in different funding rounds Categories Domain of the startup YCombinator Year Founding Year Headquarters City City of the startup Dataset 3: List of startups Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddarthareddyt/startup-analysis-dataset Source: Kaggle Format of the dataset: CSV Description: The dataset consists of all companies in the categories of software, technology, and others combined. The dataset consists of a list of startups, with the following columns - Name, Category list, funding total in USD, Status, Country Code, State Code, City, Funding rounds, Investors and Number of investors. Reasons to choose this dataset: Theis dataset on Kaggle includes data of all startups in the USA having a unique column named ‘Status’ which shows the current status of the startup(operating/closed/acquired). In order to achieve a well rounded analysis, this dataset allows us to analyze the startups which became successful vs that shutdown and helps us to visualize the distribution effectively. Column Name Description Company Name Name of the startup Category List Domain of the startup Funding total in USD Amount raised in different funding rounds in USD Status Status of the startup Country Code Code of the country State Code Code of the state City City of the startup Funding rounds Amount raised in different funding rounds Investors Investing companies Number of Investors Number of investing companies 2.2.1 Task Analysis Step 1: Understanding the data we require The startup dataset is analyzed and understood by determining context and its business alignment. Step 2: Data pre-processing The categorical variables are identified and encoded before plotting or numerical variables, which can be normalized before analysis to give a better understanding of their impact. Step 3: Data cleansing The irrelevant and missing parts in the dataset are noted and data transformation and reduction techniques are used to increase the storage efficiency and interpretability. Step 4: Exploratoratory Data Analysis Step 4.1 Identify the relationship of all variables against each other Step 4.2 Identify strongly related variables Step 4.3 Identify features with more importance Step 4.4 Group variables and create plots to summarize their effect on the other Step 5: Inferential Statistical Modelling of the result The statistical measures are noted down from the observed analysis to get clarity if our prediction is strongly supported by mathematical figures like mean, median, mode or percentile, quartiles. Step 6: Formulate the results and observations The observations are formulated from each graph into stable inferences, which can be confidently reported after the analysis is conducted. Step 7: Communicate A formal report is generated, stating our observations in detail and the learnings from the startup’s initial journey to analyze its future. 2.2.2 Summary The first contribution of our study is a qualitative review of the entrepreneurial success of purpose-built startups - the success factors identified by corporate practices are analyzed. The second contribution of our study is the set of qualitative findings related to entrepreneurial success factors. Starting from a set of factors, we analyze and explore the more relevant findings and the representative gaps between the factors. The third contribution is to find additional factors which may impact the success of startups which are found by statistical analysis of the data. In summary, we will identify the primary and secondary factors influencing startup growth. A start-up, as the term implies, is a new firm that is innovative. While the motivation to start a business is the most important aspect. There are other more aspects that can influence its success. Building the right team, the proper founding team, financing prospects, the age of the firm before launch, and many other criteria are all critical. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources Dataset description - The startup dataset is a combination of two datasets: the Unicorn startup dataset and the failed startup dataset. The Unicorn dataset provides information about the valuation, the founding year, country, city, industry, the investors, the total amount raised, the financial stage, investors count, the deal terms, and portfolio exits. It has a total of 13 columns. The datatypes involved in this dataset are categorical and numerical, having a few missing values. The failed startup dataset provides information regarding the status, the amount raised in different funding rounds, categories, and headquarters city. It has a total of 6 columns. The datatypes involved in this dataset are categorical and numerical, having a few missing values. Datasets usually have three general properties: Dimensionality: The number of attributes the objects in a dataset have. The two start-up datasets have many features and thus can be considered high-dimensional datasets. Sparsity: It happens when a significant portion of the variable’s cells do not contain any actual data. This type can be an empty or Null value and includes missing values. In the two datasets, some columns have sparse data. Resolution: The level of resolution affects the patterns in the data. A pattern may not be seen or taken as noise data if the resolution is too fine; if the resolution is too coarse, the pattern may disappear. The two datasets are relatively coarse and sparse; thus, the patterns are easily identifiable. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation We conducted an exploratory data analysis to find out anomalies. Observations: HeadquartersCity is a column with more than 40% missing values. Deal terms and Portfolio exits are irrelevant and do not impact our analysis. When you have clean data, you can make decisions using the highest-quality information and eventually boost productivity. Most data cleaning procedures adhere to a common framework: choose the important data points that are necessary for your study. Gather the information you want, then sort and arrange it. Find and eliminate any values that are redundant or unnecessary. Similar steps were taken by us: We determined which columns weren’t important for our study and then got to work removing them. Then, we looked for NULL or 0 values in the data. When we saw that the City Column had several missing values, we decided to replace null with the word “Others” because it was a pertinent column and couldn’t be replaced with anything else. Additionally, we made sure that all of the numerical columns were changed to numeric for analysis simplicity. Strategies used for missing value imputation: We have cleaned the dataset in such a way that we find a close and appropriate result. HeadquartersCity with Null values has been filled with “Others” to treat them as a separate category. We have removed data columns that were not relavent to our analysis, such as Deal terms and Portfolio exits. 3.3 Missing value analysis After analyzing each column in both datasets, we carefully understand the reasons behind the missing values as it is crucial to find out the strategy for handling them. There are two primary ways of handling missing values: a. Deleting the missing rows This approach is used when the missing value is of the type Missing Not At Random(MNAR). It can be deleted if it belongs to this category. The datasets chosen do not have missing values at random and thus, we do not delete the individual rows. Also, since every row does not have many missing values, we do not delete the rows. b. Imputing the missing values If there is a possibility of making an educated guess, as to which category the missing values belong to, this value can be included in the columns having missing values. Thus, we choose this technique to include ‘Others’ as a value in the Headquarters city column of AB dataset which categorizes all other cities as other. The failed startup dataset has one column having more than 40% rows to be missing. These missing values pertain to the Headquarters city column. The dataset has been imputed with the string value ‘Others’ and treated as a separate category. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results The following graphs demonstrate the exploratory data analysis conducted- Graph 1: Valuation of top 10 unicorns by founding year Inference from the above scatterplot Companies like SpaceX, Stripe, and ByteDance have become successful with a valuation of above $90B. We infer that companies with seeding and initial funding have the edge over startups without funding, hence the valuation difference. In 2012, there was a peak in the number of unicorn startups(4). Graph 2: Top 10 most successful unicorn investors Inference from the above bubble plot: We see that Sequoia Capital China has invested in a significant number of startups which are valued above $7B, whereas other Unicorn investors have invested in growing startups, with valuation below $6B. Accel has invested in most number of startups, whereas investors like Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management have invested in lesser number of startups. Graph 3: Industry having most valuated unicorns Inference from the above plot: Internet software &amp; services and Fintech are the major industries having significant and higher valuation whereas data management and analytics is the industry having least valuation. This suggests that the number of investors for startups are higher in Internet software &amp; services and Fintech industries. Artificial Intelligence domain has the most valuation over $4B despite the fact that it has comparatively less number of investors. Graph 4: Total raised with respect to total valuation in financial stage Inference from the above scatterplot: As we can see in the figure, startups like UBTech Robotics, Blockchain and Meizu technology have significant amount raised. This indicates that corporate and IPO acquired sectors have more funding and are seen as emerging sources of economic growth. Fields like blockchain and stocks having higher scope of growth and have significant number of investors. Graph 5: Investor Distribution among Successful Unicorns Inference form the above histogram: The class distribution of number of investors is right skewed as seen in the above histogram. Most of the startups have less than 20 investors. Very few(~50 startups) have more than 30 investors. Graph 6: Distribution of Startups over Founded Year Inference from the above histogram: The above histogram is left-skewed. We see that 2015-2020 were the best years when most number of stratups were found However there is a strange dip after 2015. The gradual increase in the number of startups shows that the industry is growing. Graph 7: Founding year with unicorn valuation and count Inference from the above bubble-plot: The number of venture capital funds keeps rising for a given unicorn from the founded year. This surge can be explained by the fact that there is abundance of liquidity for startups, as they prefer to move from private to public markets. Various startups founded in 2020 in growing domains such as blockchain and stock markets, are valued below $10B. Graph 8: Unicorn location with number of investors and valuation Inference from the above bubble-plot: We see from the above plot that UK has highest average valuation for a given number of unicorns. This can be attributed to various reasons such as ease of doing business, manageable taxation system, Innovator visas and access to funding. China and United States have significant number of unicorns with valuations above $3B, indicating expansion of consumer markets and affordable labor costs. Some countries like India, Canada and Germany have just entered the market and have started to establish stable unicorn startups. Graph 9: Top 10 Categories with maximum failed startups Inference from the above barplot: Technology sector has the the most innovations in building a startup culture, which leads to major successes and failures as indicated in the plot. Market necessity, impactful business model and passionate teams play a major role in building startup ventures. Medical and education sectors have least failed startups indicating that the innovation and improvement in strategies are helping in building advanced technologies to cure diseases and strategically extending education opportunities to inaccessible and remote areas. Graph 10: Percentage of Dead Startups by Headquarters City Inference from the above pie-chart: A high percentage of startups are from Rio De Janeiro, San Francisco, San Jose, Sunnyvale and Wilmington. Arlington Heights and Atlanta have the least share of dead startups indicating establishment of new startups or no startups. However, any major conclusions cannot be drawn from this interpretation as we miss the bigger picture, as to the count of startups in these cities. However the city distribution of the data cannot be an analyzed more than 40% of the data is classified as others. Graph 11: Amount raised in different funding rounds Inference from the above barplot: Funding round amounts and stages vary widely depending on the company’s size, previous funding rounds and the company’s value. Currently operating startups have pre-seed, seed, angel and series funding which helps in evaluation of strategies and improvising feedbacks. Exited and dead startups have lesser average funding amount, due to stagnated idea progression and incompetitive market evaluation. Graph 12: Categories with status of startups Inference from the stacked barplot: We see from the plot that the medical field has startups which are operating and are open to innovation and growth, and henceforth there are no dead or exited startups. In 90% of the domains, the number of operating startups are higher compared to the dead or exited startups. Curated_Web and Technology domains have maximum number of startups and have a good ratio in the number of existing startups as well. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component Here is the link to the interactive plot created: Interactive Line Chart of Unicorn, Operating and Exited Startups over years The interactive line chart created using a multi series data of the number of unicorn, operating and exited startup over years from 2005 to 2015. Steps followed: 1. Data Preparation 2. Scales Preparation 3. Adding Axes 4. Line Chart 5. Event Triggers 6. Circles and Labels The graph shows how the unicorns and operating have continued to grow over time. However, the number of exited startups remains revolving around a point without significant drop or growth. The graph demonstrates how operating and unicorn populations have increased throughout time. The number of shut down starts, however, continues to fluctuate about a fixed point with no appreciable increase or decrease. Up until 2010, unicorn populations grew moderately, but since then, they have expanded exponentially. A significant increase in the number of operational startups can be readily seen since 2010, which also marked an inflection point for the number of businesses that have exited. The apex denotes the startup industry’s continued expansion and a declining anxiety among startup founders that their companies may fail due to minor setbacks. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion While working on the Unicorn and failed startup datasets, we came across various types of concepts from missing value imputation to using interactive plotting strategies. From the above exploratory data analysis and visualizations, we infer that initial funding is a major requirement for a company’s growth and this depends on the investment of ideas within the company. In a startup culture, the objective is to enhance innovative strategies to tackle global problems. This objective can be achieved when the average funding received by the company in various seeding rounds increase over-time, and which further leads to more number of investors investing in the company. By exploring the datasets, we can conclude that there are a variety of reasons for a startup’s success which is determined by the industry-specific conditions, the number of investing organizations, the initial funding received and the scope of the domain. The right combination of factors have a huge impact on the success of a startup; for example, a very low or a very high number of investors prove to be detrimental to the success of any given startup in a particular domain. The startup’s growth is determined by the above factors which leads to the success or failure. The failure or success of a startup is directly related to adoption of constructive feedbacks and implementation of newer and enhanced technologies, and thus is dependant on amounts received in different funding rounds received by different investors.
