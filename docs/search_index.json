The Unicorn dataset provides information about the valuation, the founding year, country, city, industry, the investors, the total amount raised, the financial stage, investors count, the deal terms, and portfolio exits. It has a total of 13 columns. The datatypes involved in this dataset are categorical and numerical, having a few missing values. The failed startup dataset provides information regarding the status, the amount raised in different funding rounds, categories, and headquarters city. It has a total of 6 columns. The datatypes involved in this dataset are categorical and numerical, having a few missing values. Datasets usually have three general properties: Dimensionality is the number of attributes the objects in a dataset have. The two start-up datasets have many features and thus can be considered high-dimensional datasets. Sparsity: It happens when a significant portion of the variable’s cells do not contain any actual data. This type can be an empty or Null value and includes missing values. In the two datasets, some columns have sparse data. Resolution: The level of resolution affects the patterns in the data. A pattern may not be seen or taken as noise data if the resolution is too fine; if the resolution is too coarse, the pattern may disappear. The two datasets are relatively coarse and sparse; thus, the patterns are easily identifiable. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation We conducted an exploratory data analysis to find out anomalies. Observations: HeadquartersCity is a column with more than 40% missing values. Deal terms and Portfolio exits are irrelevant and do not impact our analysis. Strategies used for missing value imputation: We have cleaned the dataset in such a way that we find a close and appropriate result. HeadquartersCity with Null values has been filled with “Others” to treat them as a separate category. We have removed data columns that were not relavent to our analysis, such as Deal terms and Portfolio exits. 3.3 Missing value analysis After analyzing each column in both datasets, we carefully understand the reasons behind the missing values as it is crucial to find out the strategy for handling them. There are two primary ways of handling missing values: a. Deleting the missing rows This approach is used when the missing value is of the type Missing Not At Random(MNAR). It can be deleted if it belongs to this category. The datasets chosen do not have missing values at random and thus, we do not delete the individual rows. Also, since every row does not have many missing values, we do not delete the rows. b. Imputing the missing values If there is a possibility of making an educated guess, as to which category the missing values belong to, this value can be included in the columns having missing values. Thus, we choose this technique to include ‘Others’ as a value in the Headquarters city column of AB dataset which categorizes all other cities as other. The failed startup dataset has one column having more than 40% rows to be missing. These missing values pertain to the Headquarters city column. The dataset has been imputed with the string value ‘Others’ and treated as a separate category. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results Loading the file Plots Graph 1: Valuation of top 10 unicorns by founding year Inference from the above scatterplot Companies like SpaceX, Stripe, and ByteDance have become successful with a valuation of above $90B. We infer that companies with seeding and initial funding have the edge over startups without funding, hence the valuation difference. In 2012, there was a peak in the number of unicorn startups(4). Top 10 most successful unicorn investors Inference from the above bubble plot: We see that Sequoia Capital China has invested in a significant number of startups which are valued above $7B, whereas other Unicorn investors have invested in growing startups, with valuation below $6B. Accel has invested in most number of startups, whereas investors like Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management have invested in lesser number of startups. Industry having most valuated unicorns Inference from the above plot: Internet software &amp; services and Fintech are the major industries having significant and higher valuation whereas data management and analytics is the industry having least valuation. This suggests that the number of investors for startups are higher in Internet software &amp; services and Fintech industries. Artificial Intelligence domain has the most valuation over $4B despite the fact that it has comparatively less number of investors. Total raised with respect to total valuation in financial stage Inference from the above scatterplot: As we can see in the figure, startups like UBTech Robotics, Blockchain and Meizu technology have significant amount raised. This indicates that corporate and IPO acquired sectors have more funding and are seen as emerging sources of economic growth. Fields like blockchain and stocks having higher scope of growth and have significant number of investors. Founding year with unicorn valuation and count Inference from the above bubble-plot: The number of venture capital funds keeps rising for a given unicorn from the founded year. This surge can be explained by the fact that there is abundance of liquidity for startups, as they prefer to move from private to public markets. Various startups founded in 2020 in growing domains such as blockchain and stock markets, are valued below $10B. Unicorn location with number of investors and valuation Inference from the above bubble-plot: We see from the above plot that UK has highest average valuation for a given number of unicorns. This can be attributed to various reasons such as ease of doing business, manageable taxation system, Innovator visas and access to funding. China and United States have significant number of unicorns with valuations above $3B, indicating expansion of consumer markets and affordable labor costs. Some countries like India, Canada and Germany have just entered the market and have started to establish stable unicorn startups. Top 10 Categories with maximum failed startups Inference from the above barplot: Technology sector has the the most innovations in building a startup culture, which leads to major successes and failures as indicated in the plot. Market necessity, impactful business model and passionate teams play a major role in building startup ventures. Medical and education sectors have least failed startups indicating that the innovation and improvement in strategies are helping in building advanced technologies to cure diseases and strategically extending education opportunities to inaccessible and remote areas. Percentage of Dead Startups by Headquarters City Inference from the above pie-chart: A high percentage of startups are from Rio De Janeiro, San Francisco, San Jose, Sunnyvale and Wilmington. Arlington Heights and Atlanta have the least share of dead startups indicating establishment of new startups or no startups. However, any major conclusions cannot be drawn from this interpretation as we miss the bigger picture, as to the count of startups in these cities. However the city distribution of the data cannot be an analyzed more than 40% of the data is classified as others. Amount raised in different funding rounds Inference from the above barplot: Funding round amounts and stages vary widely depending on the company’s size, previous funding rounds and the company’s value. Currently operating startups have pre-seed, seed, angel and series funding which helps in evaluation of strategies and improvising feedbacks. Exited and dead startups have lesser average funding amount, due to stagnated idea progression and incompetitive market evaluation. Categories with status of startups Inference from the stacked barplot: We see from the plot that the medical field has startups which are operating and are open to innovation and growth, and henceforth there are no dead or exited startups. In 90% of the domains, the number of operating startups are higher compared to the dead or exited startups. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component Here is the link to the ineractive plot created: Interactive Line Chart of Unicorn, Operating and Exited Startups over years The interactive line chart created using a multi series data of the number of unicorn, operating and exited startup over years from 2005 to 2015. Steps followed: 1. Data Preparation 2. Scales Preparation 3. Adding Axes 4. Line Chart 5. Event Triggers 6. Circles and Labels The graph shows how the unicorns and operating have continued to grow over time. However, the number of exited startups remains revolving around a point without significant drop or growth. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion While working on the Unicorn and failed startup datasets, we came across various types of concepts from missing value imputation to using interactive plotting strategies. From the above exploratory data analysis and visualizations, we infer that initial funding is a major requirement for a company’s growth and this depends on the investment of ideas within the company. In a startup culture, the objective is to enhance innovative strategies to tackle global problems. This objective can be achieved when the average funding received by the company in various seeding rounds increase over-time, and which further leads to more number of investors investing in the company. The startup’s growth is determined by the above factors which leads to the success or failure. The failure or success of a startup is directly related to adoption of constructive feedbacks and implementation of newer and enhanced technologies, and thus is dependant on amounts received in different funding rounds received by different investors.
